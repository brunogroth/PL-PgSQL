# PL-PgSQL
This is a repo for PL-PgSQL study notes and records.

- PL/pgSQL _(Procedural Language/PostgreSQL)_ is a fully featured programming language that allows **much more procedural control than SQL**, including the ability to use **loops** and other control structures. **SQL statements and triggers can call functions** created in the PL/pgSQL language.
- The design of PL/pgSQL aimed to allow PostgreSQL users to perform more **complex operations** and computations than SQL.
- It closely resembles Oracle's PL/SQL language.

This repository is as simple as some functions and procedures for data manipulation

You can download the .sql file and run it on your preferral DBMS (such as <a href="https://www.heidisql.com/" target="_blank">HeidiSQL</a>, <a href="https://dbeaver.io/download/" target="_blank">DBeaver</a>, <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/" target="_blank">pgAdmin</a>) and check it out.
